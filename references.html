<blockquote>
  "Jonathan is curious, self-motivated, and tenacious. When presented with a problem to solve, he cannot resist throwing himself into the exploration which, given his depth of knowledge, usually leads to a efficient solution.
  <br />
  <br />
  He is proficient in all stages of a development work cycle, from initial estimates, to more detailed specification writing, to execution, code writing and testing, which makes him a valuable asset on a development team. He's also a great team member - a positive, articulate communicator who gives and accepts feedback with ease.
  <br />
  <br />
  At Advomatic, we build large, complex Drupal systems, and Jonathan has worked on our most complicated projects, steadily delivering clean, working code in record time. He is a pleasure to work with and I can recommend him with no reservations."

<blockquote>
  "Jonathan has been an indispensable developer in so many projects we've worked on together, medium to large. He's often the go-to guy when complex custom functionality is required, and he's always eager to roll up his sleeves, take ownership, and sweat the details. In the Drupal world, there's hardly an important subsystem or module out there without a patch or insight by grndlvl. Jonathan has a deep working knowledge of Drupal internals and cares greatly about its success as a project. I can't recall how many times a cloud of indecision was lifted after an in-depth conversation with him about various technical options. In all, Jonathan is a standout developer who is committed to his team, clients, and work."

  “Jonathan is a heavy hitter on any team he's on. He's the kind of guy that can step in and you know it'll be done (and done correctly). He takes a lot of pride and ownership in his work. As a Drupal developer, he knows its ins and outs like nobody's business. He knows the Forms API so well that he can explain it better than their own handbook.”
